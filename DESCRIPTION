Description: Classifies the type of cancer using routinely collected data
    commonly found in cancer registries from pathology reports. The
    package implements the International Classification of Diseases for
    Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3) and the World Health Organization
    (WHO) classification of tumors. Information on the site (topography),
    histology (morphology), and behaviour of neoplasms are used to
    classify the type of cancer.
