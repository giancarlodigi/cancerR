Description: Classifies the type of cancer using routinely collected data commonly
    found in cancer registries from pathology reports. The package implements the
    International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3)
    and the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors. Information 
    on the site (topography), histology (morphology), and behaviour of neoplasms
    are used to classify the type of cancer.
